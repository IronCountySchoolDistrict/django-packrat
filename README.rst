########################################

Django-packserver implements a development environment that utilizes 
webpack and browsersync to build your js, css, sass, images, fonts and other assets. 
It also implements auto-reload for .js and .py files, 
and performs hot-reload for sass files so you don't 
need to refresh your page to see style changes.
